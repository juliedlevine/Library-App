COPY books (id, title, author, description, cover) FROM stdin;
41	The Girl On The Train	Paula Hawkins	Fast read.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490903702m/22557272.jpg
42	When Breath Becomes Air	Paul Kalanithi	I listened to this as an audiobook and was totally hooked.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492677644m/25899336.jpg
45	The Paris Architect	Charles Belfoure	I was on a WWII kick recently and this was one of my favorites from that genre. 	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1375064865m/17456328.jpg
46	The Martian	Andy Weir	This was so fascinating. When I read that all the science is actually accurate and verified by NASA employees I thought it was the coolest thing.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1413706054m/18007564.jpg
48	Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince	J.K. Rowling	Had to include at least one Harry Potter book. This one is my favorite.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361039191m/1.jpg
49	The Nightingale	Kristin Hannah	My favorite book at the moment. It's SO GOOD. First book I recommend to anyone.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451446316m/21853621.jpg
50	The Glass Castle	Jeannette Walls	This book is super sad but it's amazing.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400930557m/7445.jpg
51	A Man Called Ove	Fredrik Backman	This one was slow at first but ended up being so sweet. I loved it!	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405259930m/18774964.jpg
52	Fight Club	Chuck Palahniuk	Everyone should read this.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1357128997m/5759.jpg
38	Ready Player One	Ernest Cline	Favorite sci fi book!	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1489368740m/9969571.jpg
23	Siddhartha	Hermann Hesse	In the novel, Siddhartha, a young man, leaves his family for a contemplative life, then, restless, discards it for one of the flesh. He conceives a son, but bored and sickened by lust and greed, moves on again. Near despair, Siddhartha comes to a river where he hears a unique sound. This sound signals the true beginning of his lifeâ€”the beginning of suffering, rejection, peace, and, finally, wisdom.	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428715580m/52036.jpg
